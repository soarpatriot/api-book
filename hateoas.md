### HATEOAS 

HATEOAS is a tricky subject to explain, but it is actually rather simple. It
stands for Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State, and is pronounced as
either hat-ee-os, hate O-A-S or hate-ee-ohs; the latter of which sounds a little
like a cereal for API developers


Simple:
```
1.Content negotiation
2.Hypermedia controls
```
